 CVS PHARMACY - NEXT STEPS & TEST URLS
===============================================

🚀 STEP 1: RESTART SERVER
========================
Run this command to restart with the mail order fix:

    .\restart_and_test.bat

Or manually:

    # Stop current server (Ctrl+C in server window)
    # Then start fresh:
    python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --reload

🧪 STEP 2: TEST THE MAIL ORDER FIX
==================================
1. Open: http://127.0.0.1:8080/static/index.html
2. Login: john.smith@cvshealth.com / password123
3. Ask: "How do I access a member's mail order history?"

🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Enhanced response mentioning the specific document found
- "📚 Related Documents Found" section with document details
- Server logs showing "🔍 Using mail order history response"

📊 ALTERNATIVE TEST QUERIES:
- "What is contraceptive coverage?" (should show document results)
- "How do I add a credit card?" (general response)
- "Tell me about automatic refills" (should find refill documents)
