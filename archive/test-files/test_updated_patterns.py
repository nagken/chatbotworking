For St. Joseph's Women's Contraceptive Coverage, a specific process is outlined for entering member information in RXCADS. This involves mirroring information from AS400, including effective dates and family types, but changing the Xwalk. The ID used for the main account needs to have 'WPS' added to the front when entering it into X3917 in RXCADS.
