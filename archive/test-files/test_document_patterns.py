This card allows access to a list of no-cost contraceptives. Employees are trained on how to handle private health information related to this coverage. (Document: 106 29750e RxCard DM080718.pdf)

For St. Joseph's Women's Contraceptive Coverage, the process involves mirroring information from AS400 to RXCADS under X3917, specifically the Account and Group number for X0247. The carrier code and ID/Xwalk are changed, with "WPS" added to the front of the main account ID. Effective dates and family types are mirrored from AS400, with only the Xwalk needing to be changed.
